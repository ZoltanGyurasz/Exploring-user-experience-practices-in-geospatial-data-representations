## shapefile-to-geopackage &mdash; Convert Shapefiles to GeoPackage

This package converts Shapefiles and Shapefile zips to layers in a GeoPackage

### Usage

```js
ShapefileToGeoPackage.convert({
  shapefile: path to Shapefile,
  geopackage: path to GeoPackage file
}, function(status, callback) {
  callback();
}, function(err, geopackage) {
  // geopackage now has a feature table with the shapefile data in it
});
```

### Conversion Options

The following options can be passed to addLayer and convert in the options object.  Calling the convert method with a string argument in the options object for geopackage will result in no operation if the file already exists.  In this case you should call the addLayer method which will append to the geopackage file.

| option       | type    |  |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------- |
| `geopackage`     | varies  | This option can either be a string or a GeoPackage object.  If the option is a string it is interpreted as a path to a GeoPackage file.  If that file exists, it is opened.  If it does not exist, a new file is created and opened. |
| `shapezipData`   | Buffer  | Buffer with the data for a zip file containing a shapefile and it's associated files |  
| `shapeData` | Buffer | Buffer with the data for a shapefile (.shp) |
| `shapefile` | String | Interpreted as a path to a .shp or .zip file |
| `dbfData` | String | Only used if the 'shapeData' parameter was provided.  Buffer with the data for a dbf file (.dbf) |
